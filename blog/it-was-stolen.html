		<p>Have you ever wonder where the music came from? How it was began? In our time, music is one of the most influential thing in this world. It can affect your entire being; your spirit, your thoughts, your heart and even your life. It can influence your mood; it can make you fall inlove, it can make you inspired, it can make you iritated, it can make you angry, etc. But that's not all; <strong>Music is one of the most powerful instrument of Satan to Conquer human lives.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>Before I continue, i will tell you a short story that I have experienced as a Christian.</p>
		
		<p>This happened when I heard the news about the popular band's vocalist who commits suicide. I am saddened by this news and it catch up my attention to find out the reason of his death. According to the news, it has to do with all the things that he went through in the past that led to his depression and led to suicide. They said that he was a victim of a sexual abuse when he was young. After knowing all of this things, i decided to listen to all the song that he wrote and make an experiment. I listen to his song with my earphone. While listening, I was very shocked in every track that my ear could hear. Behind the beautiful music, there was a secret message revealing in me. I feel his agony, frustration, sorrow and emptiness. And suddenly my tears flowed into my eyes. My heart was filled with regret for his life. He turn his frustation into music.</p>
